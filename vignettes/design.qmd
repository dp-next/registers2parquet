## Core functionality

This is the list of the core functionality in the `registers2parquet`
package:

1.  Converts Danish register data from SAS files to the modern and
    efficient Parquet format.
2.  Read register Parquet files into R as a DuckDB table.
3.  Provides functions to list available SAS or Parquet register files
    (e.g., SAS or Parquet) directly from R.

## Conversion process

## Parallel processing

Each register-year pairing (including duplicate years) are sent to a
separate process. That way, rather than converting 1000+ registers one
after the other, it can be split into chunks based on the number of
available CPU cores. For instance, if you set the number of "workers"
(cores) to 4, than the 1000+ registers will be split into 4 groups and
each group will be processed simultaneously on its own core.

There are some overheads to parallel processing, so it works best with a
large number of files and when the files are also relatively large, or
if the processing time per file is substantial.

## Visual representation of data flow

## Naming conventions

In the sections below, we outline the naming conventions of actions and
objects in the package. **Actions** are verbs that describe what a
function does, while **objects** are nouns that represent the parameters
that the functions operate on.

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| convert | Convert a register SAS file (or multiple) to Parquet. |
| get | Used for internal helper functions to e.g., get or extract the year from a file name. |
| list | List or retrieve an object or multiple objects. E.g., a path, a register name, or a year from a file name. |
| read | Read a Parquet register into R as a DuckDB table. |

: Actions used in `registers2parquet`.

<!-- TODO: Should the registers2parquet function be called something with the action *convert* instead? Or do we like the simplicity of it having be the same name as the package? -->

### Objects

| Object | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `output_path` | A character scalar with the absolute path to the directory where the Parquet file should be created in. |
| `path` | A character vector with the absolute path to a file or directory. It can be a single path or multiple paths as a character vector. Is used in functions to list available files or to specify input files. |
| `project_id` | A character scalar with the DST project number to the folder containing the raw or work data. |
| `register_name` | A character scalar with the name of a register used in the file name (without a path), e.g., "bef". It's used in `list` functions to retrieve the paths of objects including that name. |

: Objects used in `registers2parquet`.

## Expected flow

We expect the flow of using the `registers2parquet` package to convert
register SAS files to Parquet files will be as follows:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow
%%| fig-cap: "Flow of the expected flow using the `convert_to_parquet()` package to convert register SAS files to Parquet files."
%%| fig-alt: "A flowchart showing the expected flow of converting register SAS files to Parquet files using the `registers2parquet` package. It includes identifying paths to the relevant SAS files using the helper functions, calling the main function `convert_to_parquet()`, which then outputs the path to the written Parquet files."

    convert_to_parquet --> output

```

We expect a flow of reading a Parquet register created by the
`registers2parquet` package into an R session to be as follows:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-flow-use
%%| fig-cap: "Flow of the expected flow of reading a Parquet register that was created with the `registers2parquet` package."
%%| fig-alt: "A flowchart showing the expected flow of reading a Parquet register created with the `registers2parquet` package. It includes using the register name to read a specific register into the R session using the `read_register_parquet()` function, which outputs the register as a DuckDB table."

    project_id[/"project_id<br>[Character scalar]"/]
    path[/"path<br>[Character scalar]"/]

    read_register("read_register()")

    output[/"Output<br>[DuckDB table]"/]

    %% Edges
    path & project_id --> read_register --> output

```
