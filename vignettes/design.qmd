## Parallel processing

Each register-year pairing (including duplicate years) are sent to a separate process.
That way, rather than converting 1000+ registers one after the other, it can be split
into chunks based on the number of available CPU cores. For instance, if you set the 
number of "workers" (cores) to 4, than the 1000+ registers will be split into 4 groups
and each group will be processed simultaneously on its own core. 

There are some overheads to parallel processing, so it works best with a large number of
files and when the files are also relatively large, or if the processing time per file is
substantial.
