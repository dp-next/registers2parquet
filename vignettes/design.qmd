## Core functionality

This is the list of the core functionality in the `registers2parquet`
package:

1.  Converts Danish register data from SAS files to the modern and
    efficient Parquet format.
2.  Read register Parquet files into R as a DuckDB table.
3.  Provides functions to list available SAS or Parquet register files
    (e.g., SAS or Parquet) directly from R.

## Parallel processing

Each register-year pairing (including duplicate years) are sent to a
separate process. That way, rather than converting 1000+ registers one
after the other, it can be split into chunks based on the number of
available CPU cores. For instance, if you set the number of "workers"
(cores) to 4, than the 1000+ registers will be split into 4 groups and
each group will be processed simultaneously on its own core.

There are some overheads to parallel processing, so it works best with a
large number of files and when the files are also relatively large, or
if the processing time per file is substantial.

## Naming conventions

In the sections below, we outline the naming conventions of actions and
objects in the package. **Actions** are verbs that describe what a
function does, while **objects** are nouns that represent the parameters
that the functions operate on.

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| convert | Convert a register SAS file (or multiple) to Parquet. |
| get | Used for internal helper functions to e.g., get or extract the year from a file name. |
| list | List or retrieve an object or multiple objects. E.g., a path, a register name, or a year from a file name. |
| read | Read a Parquet register into R as a DuckDB table. |

: Actions used in `registers2parquet`.

<!-- TODO: Should the registers2parquet function be called something with the action *convert* instead? Or do we like the simplicity of it having be the same name as the package? -->

### Objects

| Object | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `output_path` | A character scalar with the absolute path to the directory where the Parquet file should be created in. |
| `path` | A character vector with the absolute path to a file or directory. It can be a single path or multiple paths as a character vector. Is used in functions to list available files or to specify input files. |
| `project_id` | A character scalar with the DST project number to the folder containing the raw or work data. |
| `register_name` | A character scalar with the name of a register used in the file name (without a path), e.g., "bef". It's used in `list` functions to retrieve the paths of objects including that name. |

: Objects used in `registers2parquet`.

## Functions

`registers2parquet` includes two main functions and multiple helper
functions. Each function is listed below with a short description.

### Main functions

#### `convert_to_parquet()`

This is the main function of the package. It takes as input one or more
SAS files, reads them, merges them if necessary, and saves them as a
Parquet file. If multiple files are given, the function looks for a year
in the file names to use as partitioning. The function also removes any
duplicate rows before saving the data. The output is the path to the
created Parquet file(s) as specified by the `output_path` parameter.

<!-- TODO: Add link to reference documentation when ready -->

``` r
#' Convert register SAS file(s) and save to Parquet format
#'
#' If multiple paths are given, the function looks for a year (4 digits) in the
#' file names to use the year as partition, see `vignettes("design")` for more
#' information about the partitioning.
#'
#' If multiple files are given with the same year, they are merged with a full join.
#'
#' If any duplicate rows found, they are removed before saving to Parquet.
#'
#' @param input_path A character vector with the absolute path to the register SAS file(s).
#' @param output_path The path with the directory to save the output Parquet file to.
#'
#' @returns Returns a character vector with the path to the created Parquet file(s)
#'   (from `output_path`), so it can easily be used in a targets pipeline.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' convert_to_parquet(list_sas_registers("202020")), "output_directory/")
#' }
convert_to_parquet <- function(input_path, output_path) {

  # Initial setup and checks.

  checkmate::assert_character(input_path)
  checkmate::assert_character(output_path)

  if (length(input_path) > 1) {
    cli::cli_alert_success(
      "Finished merging and saving the duplicate {.val {fs::path_file(input_path)[1]}} files as a Parquet file."
    )

    )

read_sas_files <- function(input_path) {
  input_path |>

add_year_col <- function(data) {
  year <- get_database_year(input_path) |>
    unique()

    data <- data |>
      dplyr::mutate(year = year)
  } else {
    cli::cli_alert_info(
      "Could not determine year from file name(s). Will not partition by year."
    )
  }
  data
}
```

#### `read_register(register_name, project_id)`

Reads a Parquet register from the specified path and returns it as a
DuckDB table.

<!-- TODO: Add link to reference documentation when ready -->

### Helper functions

#### `list_sas_registers(project_id)`

Lists all SAS files in a given directory. It returns a character vector
of file paths with the `.sas7bdat` extension at the given directory.

<!-- TODO: Add link to reference documentation when ready -->

#### `list_parquet_registers(project_id)`

Lists all Parquet files in a given directory. It returns a character
vector of file paths with the `.parquet` or `.parq` extension at the
given directory.

<!-- TODO: Add link to reference documentation when ready -->
