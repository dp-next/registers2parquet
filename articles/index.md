# Welcome!

I wrote this documentation to help me with thinking how take the SAS
files and convert them into something that’s more modern, powerful, and
faster. But I also wrote it to make it easier to share what I’ve done
and why I’ve done it. This manual contains some documents related to
what Parquet is, what DuckDB is, and some examples of how to use these
database formats when doing data analysis.
